        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Lapschool is an opensourced website that allows you to use a verity of tools
            for your school. Many paper tools (ex. Periodic Table) have been digitalized.
            it is advised to those who use laptops to take notes and don't want to take
            an piece of paper  with them to every class. Just you, your bag and your laptop
            and that's it.
        </p>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <h3>The Periodic Table</h3>
        <p>
            This is currently the only ported "tool". It has everything that
            a regular paper periodic table would have but I added a new feature. You can click on the
            element and the site will display some additional information about that element. I am not a chemist and all data is sourced
            from Wikipedia, so please report any mistakes you find.
