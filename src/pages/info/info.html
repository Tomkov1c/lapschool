        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Lapschool is an opensourced website that allows you to use a variety of tools
            for your school. Many paper tools (ex. Periodic Table) have been digitalized.
            it is made for those who use laptops to take notes and don't want to take
            an piece of paper  with them to every class. Just you, your bag and your laptop.
            That's it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's completely <strong>free</strong> since is just a website.
        </p>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <h3>The Periodic Table</h3>
        <p>
            This is currently the only ported "tool". It has everything that
            a regular paper periodic table would have but I added a new feature. You can click on the
            element and the site will display some additional information about that element. I am not a chemist and all data is sourced
            from Wikipedia, so please report any mistakes you find.

        <h4>Element inspect</h4>
        <p>
            Is a feature that allows you to click on an element and it will display some additional
            things about the element. All elements are supported. All element data is sourced from
            Wikipedia and shortened / modified by ChatGPT (3.0). Report all mistakes you find.
        </p>
        <h4>Advanced Settings</h4>
        <p>
            On the bottom screen is a button with additional features you can activate to make the
            use easier. Settings are saved in the browser storage and will still
            be applied on page reload.
        </p>
