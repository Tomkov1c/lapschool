<h1>Development</h1>
        <p>
            Currently Lapschool is just a website and not a web app. A web app requires a server to run and save data.
            Which I don't own neither can I afford without a good way to make it break even with the cost or even generate profit.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use the website often and want it to move forward, please consider
            <a href="https://ko-fi.com/tomkliner" target="_blank">donating</a> to help me advance
            it and make it something bigger and better. If you cannot afford to donate, at least tell
            your friends or classmates about the site. Anything would help.
        </p>

        <h4>Major Update <i>(v<strong>1</strong>.1.1.1 --> v<strong>2</strong>.1.1.1)</i></h4>

            Every major update will have a new tool available for use.
        </p>
        <h4>Tools Updates <i>(v1.<strong>1</strong>.1.1 --> v1.<strong>2</strong>.1.1)</i></h4>
        <p>
            Are updates that will feature some new features to some tools in the roster.

        <p>
            Will improve performance and will have some design refreshes and so on.

        <p>
            Will have some minor updates to the text or just a color change. Usually just a
            README.md update because I forgot to update it on an update push on GitHub.
        </p>
        <h4>Seasonal Updates <i>(v1.1.1.1<strong>C</strong> --> v1.1.1.1<strong>E</strong>)</i></h4>
        <p>
            Are just the updates that will make the site more accommodate to the current season / holyday (I'm sorry Australia).
            Those updates are not going to influence the functionality and are just like a spinoff of a mainline version.
        </p>
        <h2>Just a website</h2>
        <p>
            Let me start with the fact that this is my side project. Mainly to improve my CSS and JavaScript
            skills and maybe PHP later down the line (to make it a webapp). There are a lot of tools I could make
            with just the frontend but are not as useful as those that would run on the server.
        </p>
        <h2>More than a website</h2>
        <p>
            I have many features planned for the site. For the time being I'll try to make them only 
            in fronted because I don't have a server.
